###The Problem

Once upon a time there was a young man, Ristan Red Riding Hood to see his grandmother, Brooks the Babushka, who lived across the woods. The woods is ruled by an evil wolf called Arson the Arsonist, who chucks fireballs at his victims before eating them. When Ristan gets to Brooks' house, Arson is there waiting for them. Luckily, Lian the Lumberjack hears Ristan's cries for help. Help Lian save Ristan Red Riding Hood and Brooks the Babushka!

###Your Mission

Lian knows that the secret to Arson's fireballs is that, every time he wants to fire a fireball, he must say a palindrome, or else there's no fireball. Fortunately for Lian, Ristan, and Brooks, Arson isn't very good with spelling. 

Write a function `isPalindrome`, to determine whether a string is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, then Lian must defend Brooks and Ristan, and if it's not, he can attack Arson. 

###Requirements

 - Your function should take in a single string, `arsonsWord`
 - Your function should check whether or not `arsonsWord` is a palindrome
 - Your function should return `True` or `False` depending on whether or not `arsonsWord` is a palindrome
