###The Problem

Once upon a time there was a young man, Ristan, who wanted to visit his grandmother's house, across the woods. Lurking in the woods is Big Bad Brooks, a wolf who eats those who dare enroach on his territory. Luckily for him, in the west side of the woods lives Arson, the Wolfslayer.  

###Your Mission

Create a web app, which includes the following three files:
 + `index.html`
 + `styles.css`
 + `app.js`

1. The `index.html` file must contain one photo of a camp site, a clickable `button`, and an empty `div` with an `id`.

2. The `app.js` file must include a variable, `myBag`, which is an array containing several items. Some items good for camping, others not so much.

3. When the button is clicked, a function `campingAccident` will be invoked. `campingAccident` must access the items in `myBag` and use the **getElementById** and **innerHTML** DOM methods to display the items on the page.

4. The `styles.css` file should include some basic CSS to color the background and style the text.

###What we want to see

A cool web app with one photo of a camp site and a clickable button. When the button is clicked, a line of text should be displayed containing the items that Wyatt, JD, Lindsay, and Micah should ditch in order to escape!
