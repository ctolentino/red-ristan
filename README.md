### The Problem

Once upon a time there was a young man, Ristan Red Riding Hood. One day Ristan went to see his grandmother, Brooks the Babushka, who lived across the woods. The woods are ruled by an evil wolf named Arson the Arsonist. Arson is known for throwing fireballs at people passing through the woods before eating them. When Ristan gets to Brooks' house, Arson appears! Luckily, Lian the Lumberjack hears Ristan's cries for help. Help Lian save Ristan Red Riding Hood and Brooks the Babushka!

### Your Mission

Lian knows the secret to Arson's fireballs! In order to throw a fireball, Arson must first say a pallindrome. Fortunately for Lian, Ristan, and Brooks, Arson isn't very good with spelling. 

Write a function `isPalindrome`, to determine whether a string is a palindrome. If it is a palindrome, then Lian must defend Brooks and Ristan. If it's not, he can attack Arson. 

### Requirements

 - Your function should take in a single string as its parameter, `arsonsWord`
 - Your function should check whether or not `arsonsWord` is a palindrome
 - Your function should return `True` or `False` depending on whether or not `arsonsWord` is a palindrome
